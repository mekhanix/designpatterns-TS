### Design Pattern implementations in TypeScript

> I've been bitten by a bad software design in the past few months.

As an innocent junior, I don't want to repeat my "seniors" mistakes in which he/they created 3-4 layers of questionable class inheritance to make the codes `reusable`, turns out it's a **BIG NOPE** and mentally as well as physically painful to maintain. But, I understand their position at that time, and I learned it the hard way.

The goal is pretty simple, `1 week = 1 pattern`, in parallel, I also learn TypeScript :
* week #1 : [Strategy Pattern](strategy/)
* week #2 : [Observer Pattern](observer/)
* week #2 : [Bridge Pattern](bridge/)
* week #3 : [Singleton Pattern](singleton/)
The books some dude on the internet recommend :
* The GoF (*obligatory*)
* [Head First Design Patterns](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007126.do)
